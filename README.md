4 player Monopoly web game made with HTML, SASS, JavaScript (vanilla, without any framework), and PHP with inspiration from *‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù* series.

The players names and icons are stored in a SQL database.

You can try a **fully** functional version [here]() but note that the names of the players and their icons are set by default so, if you summit the restart form, it will probably throw an error.

## Gameplay 
![General example demostration GIF](./docs/captures/gifs/GeneralExample.gif)

Players roll a dice (hitting the üé≤ icon) and choose whether to buy the properties (ü™ô) or pass (‚û°Ô∏è) and if they land on others' properties, they automatically pay rent. The game ends when only one player remains.

The game can be restarted clicking the ‚ôªÔ∏è icon and a form will appear to enter the names and preffered icon of the players.

## Final notes
I wish this was a complete port but it is not, this was part of my first course final project so a lot of stuff that I would have liked to implement, like building and cards are not here.

So... that's it! Thanks! ü§†
